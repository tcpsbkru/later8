historic moment: downloaded opentcart and coinpayments plugin, bought BTC (£100).
Uploaded to 1&1 hosting and had a session: a customer sign in, paid (~£6), and coinpayments showed money in. But open card did not update the status of transaction. 
No good dealing with a third party for bitcoins exposing the IP so trying to create 
My own bitcoin processing.
